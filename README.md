This Python script is a well-structured program designed to manage student course registrations using data classes and robust error handling. It organizes functionality into distinct classes—Person for handling personal details, Student for managing course information, FileProcessor for reading and writing data to a JSON file, and IO for user interactions—ensuring clear separation of concerns. The program validates user inputs, processes file operations, and handles errors effectively, making it both maintainable and user-friendly. The main script coordinates these components, enabling smooth registration, data display, and data storage processes.
